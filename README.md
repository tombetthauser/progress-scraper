# Welcome to Progress Scraper sub-beta!

- This consolidates the student reports from the day into a readable summary in the browser console.
- It's is currently a duct-tapepd mess, but I tried to organize a bit!
- It developed piece by piece during the June cohort, needs an overhaul...

To use it right now you just copy all of the contents of the progress-scraper.js file and paste it into your browser console in Progress Tracker while you're looking at a given day's student reports.
